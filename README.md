# Python-Health-Emergency-Response-Analytics

This project analyzes hospital emergency response data to uncover insights into patient wait times, satisfaction levels, demographic referrals, and admission trends. Using Python, Pandas, and Flask, the analysis is visualized on a web interface for better decision-making and performance tracking.

## Dataset
The dataset includes key attributes of patient records:
Patient ID
Patient Admission Date
Patient First Initial & Last Name (anonymized for privacy)
Patient Gender
Patient Age
Patient Race
Department Referral
Patient Admission Flag (indicates admission status)
Patient Satisfaction Score
Patient Wait Time
Patients CM (Case Management)

## Key Analyses Performed

# Wait Time Analysis

Average wait times segmented by department and age group.

# Satisfaction vs. Wait Time Correlation

Analyzed the relationship between wait times and patient satisfaction scores.

# Demographic and Department Referrals

Evaluated referral trends based on race, gender, and department.

# Admission Analysis

Studied admission rates segmented by demographics and department.

# Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Flask, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
HTML, CSS (Static Styling)
Flask Framework (for web hosting and data visualization)
